# Sales Analysis Project
This is a sales analysis project that utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and derive insights from sales data.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of sales data, leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and valuable insights. The analysis involves cleaning the data, removing duplicates, and applying ML algorithms for predictive and descriptive analytics.

## Installation
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/RonoAnalyst/sales-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd sales-analysis
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

##Usage
To use the project, follow these steps:
Ensure you have the necessary dataset in the data/ directory. The dataset should be a CSV file containing sales data.
Run the analysis script:
python analysis/sales_analysis.py --input data/sales_data.csv --output results/analysis_results.csv
Replace sales_data.csv with your actual dataset filename.
Explore the generated analysis results in the results/ directory.

##Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:
/sales-analysis
    ├── data/                  # Directory for storing sales data
    ├── analysis/              # Directory containing analysis scripts
    ├── results/               # Directory for storing analysis results
    ├── docs/                  # Documentation files
    └── tests/                 # Test scripts
